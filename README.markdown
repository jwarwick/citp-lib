Controller Interface Transport Protocol Library
===============================================

Library to allow easy use of the Controller Interface Transport Protcol (CITP) used in the Capture lighting visualizer.
Built on the Qt 4.5 framework.

This code is written to exercise a [Wireshark](http://wireshark.org) protocol dissector, but might be more generally useful if you want to stream data to a lighting visualizer.

Complete protocol documentation available at [CITP-Protocol.org](http://www.citp-protocol.org/).
